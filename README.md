# [Project Title]

## Overview
Provide a clear description of your project, its objectives, and key functionalities.
- **Objective:** Replace the final exam by delivering a comprehensive solution (software-based or combined with hardware using a Raspberry Pi Kit and small components) that meets the course outcomes.
- **Scope:** Describe the systems and components covered (e.g., endpoint protection, cloud security, IoT integration).

## Deliverables
- **Codebase:** All source code files organized by functionality.
- **Documentation:**
  - A comprehensive [README.md](#readme) with setup and usage instructions.
  - A GitHub Wiki detailing the project phases (Conceptualization, Design, Development, Testing, Review, Finalization), design decisions, progress updates, and testing results.
- **Project Tracking:**
  - A GitHub Project board that tracks milestones and tasks (use columns such as “To Do,” “In Progress,” “Review,” and “Completed”).
- **Video Deliverables:**
  - A series of 15‑minute demonstration videos, uploaded via Cengage Bongo (with links documented in the Wiki).
  - Videos will be peer reviewed by classmates.
